            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>My professional goal is to transition into the software and web developmet industry from the remnants of the offshore oil and gas exploration industry, in which I have until recently been employed. My main objective is to find employment within this field, using the technical knowledge I am acquiring daily from Viking Code School et al, and also building on the management, problem solving, analytical and communication skills I already possess. I am quick to learn new skills and use my own initiative to deal with problems in a resourceful manner. </p>

            <p>I have been lucky enough to travel a lot, and I have thoroughly enjoyed exploring new cultures and making friends a long the way. Now I enjoy doing just about anything with my young sons who also like to explore a lot and make friends, all be it slightly closer to home. If I get a moments spare time I  enjoy renovating properties, growing veg on the allotment and managing the beer at our local Beer Festival,(which includes the occasional taste).</p>
