      <h2>Achievements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Internet Backbone for Sony Q Music at Music Festival</h3></li>
        <p>Sony contracted Blakesberg Photography Inc. to publish videos and photos to social media in order to drive consumers into their tent at Summer Camp Music Festival. We were awarded the contract two weeks before the start of the event and due to the time and budget constraints, we were limited to a local ADSL provider. Since Sony was letting fans try out their audio subscription service in their tent, one ADSL line would not provide enough bandwidth for the 15 workstations plus mobile devices. I was able to procure equipment at a 40% savings, allowing us to aggregate 6 ADSL lines and establish a 2 mile wireless connection to the Sony tent to meet their demands. The project was finished under budget and the client had a smile on their face.</p>
        <li><h3>Image &amp; Video Metrics Database</h3></li>
        <p>Blakesberg Photography Inc. is responsible for the scanning, licensing and archival of 6000+ images from a recently deceased photographer. We needed a way to keep track of these photos so I wrote a MySQL driven Perl CGI program that maintains all of the metadata for each image and keeps track of metrics regarding the state of the images (retouching progress, payment due, etc.). It imports and organizes any new images as they are put on the server, renders previews, and updates any changes to the metadata or metrics. The web GUI allows users to find and view an image, as well as viewing the metadata and track any needed metrics. Since we are scanning film images, being able to see exactly what images have been scanned and their status has increased our efficiency threefold.</p>

        <p>I later utilized this code to develop a database to keep track of our offline video storage as our video production increased. Users can search for what is on each drive, the space remaining, and other pertinent info. This allows users to ascertain available drives and retrieve the video content they need conveniently and consistently.</p>

        <p>After learning Python, I re-wrote the backend in Python on my own time because, well Python is wonderful!</p>
