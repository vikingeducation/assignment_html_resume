    <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>My name is Jared, and I'm looking to turn a new leaf and find a new career in web development. I'm a rather multi-interested person; I've worked at nonprofits and actually majored in music at college. That being said, I believe development will be a strong fit for my personality type, and I'm glad to have previously worked on other skills, like communication, team-building, and recruitment. In the coming months, I plan on honing my skills as much as possible to reach this goal.
